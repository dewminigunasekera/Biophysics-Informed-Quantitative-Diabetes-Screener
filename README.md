# BiqDS: Biophysics-Informed Quantitative Diabetes Screener

This project develops a fully interpretable, biologically grounded diabetes risk screener using structured signal logic and hybrid probabilistic gating. Unlike black-box models, this system prioritizes high recall, transparency, and modular reasoning â€” ideal for real-world healthcare screening and research environments.

## ðŸ§  Key Concept

**BiqDS** (Biophysics-Informed Quantitative Diabetes Screener) is based on the insight that:
> _Early onset of diabetes is associated with a measurable reduction in projected longevity within phenotypic clusters._

Using this principle, the system builds a `FinalSignal` that blends:
- Cluster-level longevity estimates,
- Observed diabetes prevalence,
- Delta in life expectancy between diabetic and non-diabetic patients,
- And hybrid filters using Random Forest model confidence when needed.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Unsupervised phenotypic clustering** (`k=35`) to define biological groupings
- âœ… **Longevity modeling** from cluster-level age averages
- âœ… **Î”-longevity weights** to adjust signal confidence
- âœ… **FinalSignal**: interpretable risk score derived from biophysical and statistical logic
- âœ… **Threshold sweep** and F1 optimization
- âœ… **Hybrid filtering** with Random Forest probability for robust screening
- âœ… **High recall configuration** for maximum sensitivity

## ðŸ“Š Methodology Overview

1. **Data Cleaning & Clipping**  
   Remove impossible values and apply domain-informed outlier clipping to enhance medical validity.

2. **Clustering (KMeans)**  
   Segment patients into biological phenotype clusters using scaled input features.

3. **Longevity Modeling**  
   Compute average age per cluster and normalize to build a `LongevityScore`.

4. **Diabetes Prevalence**  
   Measure cluster-level diabetes probability.

5. **Delta-Longevity Weighting**  
   Estimate how much diabetes shortens life within each cluster to compute `DeltaLongevityWeight`.

6. **FinalSignal Construction**  
   Blend `LongevityScore` and `DiabetesProbability` with `DeltaLongevityWeight`.

7. **Threshold Optimization**  
   Sweep fixed thresholds (e.g. 0.10â€“0.25) to select high-recall, high-F1 configurations.

8. **Hybrid Rule (Optional)**  
   Apply a probability veto using a Random Forest trained on correlation-ranked features.
